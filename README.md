# Le Wagon Web Development Bootcamp Final Project - PitStop

## Concept

PitStop is a free couchsurfing service for small bands playing small to medium venues (100 - 500 capacity), that may not be able to afford to stay in a hotel or may try to drive home after the gig.

Bands often have 4 or more members and most hotels do not allow more than maybe 3 people in a room, so that means 2 hotel rooms for a 4 person band which can be expensive. Some bands may opt to not stay at all and drive back from a gig in another city on the same day. Tiredness while on the road is dangerous and people driving up to the city, doing a 2 hour performance and then driving back are bound to be tired.

PitStop is the connection between the fans and the bands, bringing the music community together to help small struggling bands. There is no money involved when a band stays at a place on PitStop, it is out of the fans' goodwill that places are made available, but bands may be willing to offer tickets or merchandise as a thank you to their host(s). 

There is no rating system, but room owners and bands can leave feedback (Shoutouts) on each others' pages, and although positivity is encouraged, it is important to acknowledge any negative experiences that could lead to rooms being removed or bands being banned. However, bands can only leave feedback on the pages of rooms that they have stayed at, and hosts can only leave feedback on the pages of bands they have hosted. This avoids any unwarranted negative feedback or possible "boosting" of profiles with false positive feedback.
